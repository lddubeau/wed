Introduction
============

Wed is a schema-aware editor for XML documents. It runs in a web
browser. Wed is used as part of the `Buddhist Translators Workbench
project <https://btw.mangalamresearch.org/>`_ as the central component
that enables a team of scholars to edit and manage lexicographical
articles.  We aim to make it extensible by means of a stable API, but
the API is likely to change quickly until we hit 1.0.

For now wed is not meant to be used alone. Rather, it is meant to be
incorporated into web applications that need to edit XML documents.

People who are actually editing documents using wed should read
:doc:`help`. You should also read it if you want to know about which
browsers wed supports.

People who would like to customize wed or create a mode for it should
consult:

* :doc:`usage` to learn how to use wed in their own application, or
  build and test it,

* :doc:`tech_notes` to learn about wed's internals, design decisions,
  or about more complex usage scenarios,

* the `API documentation <api/index.html>`_ to write modes or extensions for
  wed.
