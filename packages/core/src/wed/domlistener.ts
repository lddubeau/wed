/**
 * This class models a listener designed to listen to changes to a DOM tree and
 * fire events on the basis of the changes that it detects.
 *
 * An  ``included-element``  event is  fired  when  an  element appears  in  the
 * observed tree  whether it is directly  added or added because  its parent was
 * added.     The    opposite     events    are     ``excluding-element``    and
 * ``excluded-element``.  The event  ``excluding-element`` is  generated *before
 * the tree fragment is removed, and ``excluded-element`` *after*.
 *
 * An ``added-element`` event is fired when an element is directly added to the
 * observed tree. The opposite events are ``removing-element`` and
 * ``removed-element``.
 *
 * A ``children-changing`` and ``children-changed`` event are fired when an
 * element's children are being changed.
 *
 * A ``text-changed`` event is fired when a text node has changed.
 *
 * An ``attribute-changed`` is fired when an attribute has changed.
 *
 * A ``trigger`` event with name ``[name]`` is fired when ``trigger([name])`` is
 * called. Trigger events are meant to be triggered by event handlers called by
 * the listener, not by other code.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 *
 * Consider the following HTML fragment:
 *
 *     <ul>
 *      <li>foo</li>
 *     </ul>
 *
 * If the fragment is added to a ``<div>`` element, an ``included-element``
 * event will be generated for ``<ul>`` and ``<li>`` but an ``added-element``
 * event will be generated only for ``<ul>``. A ``changed-children`` event will
 * be generated for the parent of ``<ul>``.
 *
 * If the fragment is removed, an ``excluding-element`` and ``excluded-element``
 * event will be generated for ``<ul>`` and ``<li>`` but a ``removing-element``
 * and ``remove-element`` event will be generated only for ``<ul>``. A
 * ``children-changing`` and ``children-changed`` event will be generated for
 * the parent of ``<ul>``.
 *
 * The order in which handlers are added matters. The listener provides the
 * following guarantee: for any given type of event, the handlers will be called
 * in the order that they were added to the listener.
 *
 * <h2>Warnings:</h2>
 *
 * - Keep in mind that the ``children-changed``, ``excluded-element`` and
 *   ``removed-element`` events are generated **after** the DOM operation that
 *   triggers them. This has some consequences. In particular, a selector that
 *   will work perfectly with ``removing-element`` or ``excluding-element`` may
 *   not work with ``removed-element`` and ``excluded-element``. This would
 *   happen if the selector tests for ancestors of the element removed or
 *   excluded. By the time the ``-ed`` events are generated, the element is gone
 *   from the DOM tree and such selectors will fail.
 *
 *   The ``-ed`` version of these events are still useful. For instance, a wed
 *   mode in use for editing scholarly articles listens for ``excluded-element``
 *   with a selector that is a tag name so that it can remove references to
 *   these elements when they are removed. Since it does not need anything more
 *   complex then ``excluded-element`` works perfectly.
 *
 * - A listener does not verify whether the parameters passed to handlers are
 *   part of the DOM tree. For instance, handler A could operate on element X so
 *   that it is removed from the DOM tree. If there is already another mutation
 *   on X in the pipeline by the time A is called and handler B is called to
 *   deal with it, then by the time B is run X will no longer be part of the
 *   tree.
 *
 *   To put it differently, even if when an event is generated element X was
 *   part of the DOM tree, it is possible that by the time the handlers that
 *   must be run for that mutation are run, X is no longer part of the DOM tree.
 *
 *   Handlers that care about whether they are operating on elements that are in
 *   the DOM tree should perform a test themselves to check whether what is
 *   passed to them is still in the tree.
 *
 *   The handlers fired on removed-elements events work on nodes that have been
 *   removed from the DOM tree. To know what was before and after these nodes
 *   **before** they were removed use events that have ``previous_sibling`` and
 *   ``next_sibling`` parameters, because it is likely that the nodes themselves
 *   will have both their ``previousSibling`` and ``nextSibling`` set to
 *   ``null``.
 *
 * - Handlers that are fired on children-changed events, **and** which modify
 *   the DOM tree can easily result in infinite loops. Care should be taken
 *   early in any such handler to verify that the kind of elements added or
 *   removed **should** result in a change to the DOM tree, and ignore those
 *   changes that are not relevant.
