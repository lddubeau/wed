      handling:
        description: Determines how attributes are handled. The values
          are the same as described above with the exception that "hide" is
          not valid here.

          then no attributes are autohidden.

                  description: CSS selector matching one or more elements.
                    This selector must use the prefixes defined by the
                    mode\'s metadata. This selector is subject to
                    limitations explained in ``domutil.toGUISelector``. The
                    hiding algorithm ceases searching for matches as soon
                    as one selector matches.

                attributes:
                  description: Specifies the attributes to hide. The array
                    is executed in order when matching attributes. Later
                    elements in the array override earlier elements.

      authors:
        description: The authors of the mode.
        type: array

      description:
        description: The description of the mode.

        description: The initial label level to start. It must be less or equal
          to "max".
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
    additionalProperties: false
    required: ["max", "initial"]
  attributes:
    description: Options regarding how attributes are handled. If it is a string
      then it must be "hide", "show" or "edit".  The value "hide" means hide all
      attributes and do not allow direct editing. The value "show" means show
      the attributes but do not allow direct editing. The value "edit" means
      show attributes and allow direct editing of attributes. By "direct editing"
      we mean editing of attributes as attributes. Note that indirect editing of
      attributes is always allowed. A mode could bring up a modal didalog to
      perform an action that modifies attributes behind the scenes no matter
      what the option here says.

      Also note that a mode may prevent editing of attributes on a case-by-case
      basis by not returning actions that edit attribute values. The setting
      here operates coarsely.

      The value may be an object in order to use more features.
