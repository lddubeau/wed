/**
 * Transforms an attribute name from its unencoded form in the original XML data
 * (before transformation for use with wed) to its encoded name.
 *
 * The first thing this algorithm does is compute a difference between the
 * original XML name and how HTML will record it. The issue here is that XML
 * allows more characters in a name than what HTML allows and doing
 * ``setAttribute(name, value)`` will silently convert ``name`` to something
 * HTML likes. The issue most frequently encountered is that uppercase letters
 * are encoded as lowercase. This is especially vexing seeing as XML allows the
 * attribute names ``x`` and ``X`` to exist as different attributes, whereas
 * HTML does not. For HTML ``x`` and ``X`` are the same attribute. This function
 * records any differences between the original name and the way HTML records it
 * with a diff string that is appended to the final name after a dash. If
 * nothing appears after the final dash, then the HTML name and the XML name are
 * the same.
 *
 * A sequence of three dashes or more is converted by adding another dash. (So
 * sequences of single dash, or a pair of dashes remain unchanged. But all
 * sequences of 3 dashes or more gets an additional dash.)
 *
 * A colon (``:``) is converted to three dashes ``---``.
 *
 * After transformation above the name is prepended with ``data-wed-`` and it is
 * appended with the diff described above.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * - ``foo:bar`` becomes ``data-wed-foo---bar-``. Note how the diff is
 *    empty, because ``foo:bar`` can be represented as-is in HTML.
 *
 * - ``MOO:aBc---def`` becomes ``data-wed-moo---abc----def-u3g2u1``. Note the
 *   diff suffix, which allows restoring the orignal case.
 *
 * When ``qualifier`` is used, the qualifier is added just after ``data-wed-``
 * and is prepended and appended with a dash. So ``foo:bar`` with the qualifier
 * ``ns`` would become ``data-wed--ns-foo---bar-``. The addition of a dash in
 * front of the qualifier makes it impossible to confuse an encoding that has a
 * qualifier from one that does not, as XML attribute names are not allowed to
 * start with a dash.
 *
 * @param name The unencoded name (i.e. the attribute name as it is in XML).
 *
 * @param qualifier An optional qualifier.
 *
 * @returns The encoded name.

 * Convert a "pattern object" to a string that can be shown to the user. This
 * function is meant to be used for "complex" name patterns that we may get from
 * salve. Note that a "pattern object" is the result of calling ``toObject()``
 * on the pattern. The goal of this function is to convert the pattern object to
 * a string that would be interpretable by the end user.
 *
 * An explanation about how this handles namespaces and wildcard patterns is in
 * order. In a Relax NG schema the name pattern ``*`` in the compact notation is
 * equivalent to ``<anyName/>`` in the expanded notation. And ``foo:*`` is
 * equivalent to ``<nsName ns="uri_of_foo">`` where ``uri_of_foo`` is the URI
 * that has been associated with ``foo`` in the compact schema. It would be nice
 * if the function here could reuse this notation, but we cannot. Consider the
 * case where an Relax NG schema in the compact notation wants to declare a name
 * pattern which means "any name in the default namespace". In XML we express a
 * name in the default namespace currently in effect by simply not prefixing it
 * with a namespace name: whereas ``foo:bar`` is the ``bar`` element in the
 * ``foo`` namespace, ``bar`` is the ``bar`` element in the default
 * namespace. The pattern "any element in namespace foo" is represented with
 * ``foo:*``, however we cannot use ``*`` to mean "any element in the default
 * namespace", because ``*`` means "any name in any namespace whatsoever". The
 * compact notation forces the author of the schema to use a prefix for the
 * default namespace. And because of this, ``*`` means unambiguously "any
 * element in any namespace".
 *
 * So the ``*`` in the Relax NG schema becomes ``*:*`` here. "Any element in the
 * default namespace" is represented by ``*``. Thus ``foo:*`` and ``*`` can
 * stand in the same relation to one another as ``foo:bar`` and ``bar``.
