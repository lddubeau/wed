    # Browsers disallow just polling the clipboard randomly. So to work
    # around that, we set an element on which we have a "paste" handler
    # which allows us to read the clipboard.
    #
    # However, there's an issue with this method. Suppose a copy handler
    # which sets the data on the clipboard so that MIME type A is
    # associated with an empty string, and MIME type B is associated
    # with some non-empty string value. In Chrome, when the paste event
    # is processed, the clipboard data on the paste event will only
    # contain information for MIME type B. It is as if MIME type A was
    # never set in the first place. This seems to be some sort of
    # normalization happening behind the scenes.
    #
    # So we cannot distinguish between a MIME type not having been set
    # at all, and a MIME type set to the empty string.
