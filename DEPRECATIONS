This file keeps track of deprecations.

Since 5.0.0:

* When converting XML elements for inclusion into the GUI tree, wed creates
  elements with the ``tagName`` of the XML element as the first ``className`` of
  the new element. So the XML ``<foo>`` would become ``<div class="foo
  _local_foo _xmlns_ _real">``.

  This is problematic because the XML element ``<_phantom>``, for
  instance, would get the class ``_phantom``, which clashes with a class already
  used by wed.

  Because it is unsafe, it is hereby deprecated. A future major version will
  remove support for it. Version 5.0.0 introduces an additional class designed
  to replace the old one. In 5.0.0, the ``foo`` example above will be converted
  to ``<div class="foo _name_foo _local_foo _xmlns_ _real _el">`` The
  ``_name_foo`` class it the replacement. When the deprecated class name is
  removed, the final production will be ``<div class="_name_foo _local_foo
  _xmlns_ _real _el">``
