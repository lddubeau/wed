Introduction
============

Wed is a schema-aware editor for XML documents. It runs in a web browser. The
software is at the beta stage. It is being used in a project for editing
scholarly articles. We aim to make it extensible by means of a stable API, but
the API is likely to change quickly for now.

Wed is tested on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer.

Our extensive documentation can be
